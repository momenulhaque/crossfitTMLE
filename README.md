## How to install

```{r}
remotes::install_github("momenulhaque/crossfitTMLE") # it will install the package
library(crossfitTMLE) 
```
Now the package is ready to use. 

## Install the required R packages
The package primarily requires 'SuperLearner'. Additionally, it requires all the R packages associated with advanced machine learning algorithms.
```{r}
require(SuperLearner)
# require(randomForest) for SL.randoForest.
```
 
## Apply the crossfitTMLE function
 
```{r}
# Read the data set that you want to use. An example data set "statin_sim_data" can be found in this package.
L <- names(dplyr::select(statin_sim_data, !c(Y, statin)))
DC_tmle <- crossfitTMLE(data = statin_sim_data,
                        exposure = "statin",
                        outcome = "Y",
                        covarsT = L,
                        covarsO = L,
                        family.y = "binomial",
                        learners = "SL.glm",
                        control = list(V = 5, stratifyCV = FALSE,
                                       shuffle = TRUE, validRows = NULL),
                        num_cf = 5,
                        n_split = 3,
                        seed = 2575,
                        conf.level = 0.95, stat = "median")
